# Address-Updater
Address Updater allows the users to add, edit, delete address records.

The website ensures that there are no duplicate entries.

The project stores the data of the users as values in an object and we make use of these values to populate the table data which acts as the displayed information.

With the help of DOM manipulation, the data is inserted into the rows of the table.
